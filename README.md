Transit
=======

Transit is a bookmarks page originally developed in 2011 for use with Windows Phone 7 (WP7). The goal of this project was to organize my homescreen, which was becoming filled with bookmark after bookmark in the absence of native folder system. While the folder system in Windows Phone 8.1 renders Transit obsolete, I plan to update this project in the near future for personal practice.
